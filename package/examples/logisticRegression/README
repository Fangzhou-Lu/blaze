This is an example to train a classification model using Logistic Regression.

'app' contains the Spark application with MLLib for the model training. If 
used with the provided Spark distribution, the training can be accelerated
with FCS Runtime System. 
The useage of the application is the following:
./BIN_NAME <training data path> <testing data path> <number of partitions>
- training data path: file (file:// or hdfs://) path of training data, the 
  data format is:
  "label,feature_0 feature_1 feature_2 ... feature_n"
  and all the feature data is floating-point numbers
- testing data path: similar to training data path
- number of partitions: number of RDD partitions, equal to the number 
  of parallel Spark tasks to perform the computation

'data' contains an example training and testing data following the format

'acc_task' contains the binary and bitstream to accelerate the  
LogisticGradient calculation in spark.mllib.optimiation.LBFGS. 
- LogisticGradientWithLoss.so is the accelerator task implementation
  that is compiled with Xilinx SDAccel 2015.1.5.
- bitstream.xclbin is generated by SDAccel for FPGA board:
  "xilinx:adm-pcie-ku3:1ddr:1_1", it is not compatible with any other
  FPGA boards

To start the accelerator with nam, the following environmental variables
should be set correctly:
- XILINX_OPENCL_DIR
- XCL_PLATFORM
and to make sure 'libxilinxopencl.so' is available in the library search
paths, the following two directory should be included in LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
- $XILINX_OPENCL/lib/lnx64.o
- $XILINX_OPENCL/runtime/lib/x86_64
